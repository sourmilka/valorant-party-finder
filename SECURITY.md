# Security Guide

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Rotate Database Credentials
The MongoDB credentials in the previous `.env` file were exposed in version control. You must:

1. **Create a new MongoDB user** with a strong password
2. **Update the connection string** in your environment variables
3. **Delete the old database user** to prevent unauthorized access

### 2. Generate New JWT Secret
```bash
# Generate a secure JWT secret (32+ characters)
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

### 3. Environment Variables Setup

#### Development (.env.local)
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-new-user:secure-password@cluster.mongodb.net/valorant-party-finder
JWT_SECRET=your-generated-32-char-secret-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

#### Production (Vercel Environment Variables)
Set these in your Vercel dashboard under Settings > Environment Variables:
- `MONGODB_URI`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`

## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT-based authentication with secure token generation
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- ✅ Required authentication for all create operations
- ✅ Proper token validation and user identification

### Rate Limiting
- ✅ Database-backed rate limiting (works in serverless)
- ✅ Different limits for different endpoints:
  - Login: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
  - Party creation: 10 per hour
  - LFG creation: 15 per hour
- ✅ Proper HTTP headers for rate limit status

### Data Validation
- ✅ Input sanitization and validation
- ✅ MongoDB schema validation
- ✅ Proper error handling without information leakage

### Security Headers
- ✅ Security headers via middleware
- ✅ CORS protection
- ✅ XSS protection headers

## 🛡️ Best Practices Implemented

### Database Security
- ✅ Connection pooling with timeouts
- ✅ Automatic document expiration (TTL)
- ✅ Proper indexing for performance
- ✅ Input validation to prevent injection

### API Security
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ Error handling without stack trace exposure
- ✅ Request size limits
- ✅ Authentication required for sensitive operations

### Code Security
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets (environment variables required)
- ✅ Secure random generation for tokens
- ✅ Proper TypeScript typing for type safety

## 📋 Security Checklist

### Before Production Deployment
- [ ] Rotate all exposed credentials
- [ ] Set up proper environment variables in Vercel
- [ ] Enable MongoDB IP whitelist (if needed)
- [ ] Review and test all authentication flows
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is working
- [ ] Test error handling doesn't leak sensitive info
- [ ] Enable MongoDB audit logging (if available)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

### Ongoing Security
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Regular credential rotation
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Monitor rate limit violations
- [ ] Keep JWT secrets secure and rotate periodically

## 🚨 Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:
1. Immediately rotate all credentials
2. Check MongoDB access logs
3. Review application logs for suspicious activity
4. Consider temporarily disabling user registration
5. Notify users if data may have been compromised
